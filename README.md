# Financial Analysis with Python-Numpy
![](Images/Jup-py-num.png)

In this activity, I analyzed the financial records of a company. I was provided a financial dataset of their profits and Loss: budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. I used Numpy to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Lastly, I placed the results into an output txt file called PyBank.txt:
